          <h1>Domestic Flight Trends (2019-2020)</h1>
          <p>
            We will be examining the air traffic trends of the top 15 busiest airports in Australia during the period 2019-2020, 
            including how COVID-19 pandemic had impacted Australia's domestic air travel.
          </p>

            This dataset was downloaded from data.gov.au 
            <a href=https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-dga-c5029f2a-39b3-4aef-8ae1-73e7962f6170/details>here</a>. It contains
            monthly aggregated data of flights between Australian cities. Covers
            Regular Public Transport (RPT) air services between Australian
            airports. Data is by city pair and month for passengers carried,
            aircraft trips, great circle distance between two airports
            (connected to city), Revenue Passenger Kilometres (RPKs), Available
            Seat Kilometres (ASKs) and Seats.

            The number of flight routes and traffic varies according to the location, with the busiest airports being tied to major cities around Australia.

            The airport that has the most number of outgoing flight routes is <b><span class="brisbane_text">Brisbane</span></b>, with 16 outgoing flight routes.

          <p>
            The airports with the least amount of outgoing flight routes are tied between <b><span class="alicesprings_text">Alice Springs</span></b>,

              Five of the top 15 flight routes of them originate from <b><span class="brisbane_text">Brisbane</span></b> airport, indicating that it has the one of the most air traffic out of the top 15 airports.

            Taking a look at the line graph for total outgoing aircraft trips, 
            we can see that the top 3 airports are <b><span class="brisbane_text">Brisbane</span></b>, <b><span class="melbourne_text">Melbourne</span></b>, and <b><span class="adelaide_text">Adelaide</span></b> respectively.

            At the end of January 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declares COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern. Following the WHO's announcement of COVID-19 as a pandemic in March 2020, air travel was restricted by Australia unless exempted due to special circumstances. 
          </p>
          <p>
            These events are reflected in the line graph by a gradual drop in total aircraft trips between January and March as less people began to travel due to the COVID-19 outbreak, followed by an immediate drop in total outgoing aircraft trips after WHO's pandemic announcement and Australia's subsequent restriction of air travel in March 2020.

        <p>Quoted from <a href=https://airlinegeeks.com/2016/01/17/airline-metrics-revenue-passenger-kilometers>AirlineGeeks.com</a>:</p>
        <blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
          <b>Revenue Passenger Kilometers (RPK)</b> is an airline industry metric that shows the number of kilometers traveled by paying passengers. 
          It is calculated as the number of revenue passengers multiplied by the total distance traveled. Since it measures the actual demand for air transport, it is often referred to as airline “traffic.”
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
          They are often compared to the <b>Available Seat Kilometers (ASK)</b>, which show the total number of passenger kilometers that could be generated in order to determine the amount of revenue that comes in compared to the maximum amount.
          Airlines have to try to match their supply (ASKs) with the market demand (RPKs).
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The graph below has a rule mark that is showing when ASK is equal to RPK, which is to say when market supply is meeting the market demand. 
          Any points below the diagonal line indicate airports that have excess capacity, and any points above the diagonal line indicate airports that are unable to accomodate the demand.  
        </p>

            <div id="ask_rpk" class=vis></div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          If we take a look at March 2020, we can see that RPK started to begin to drop rapidly, as restrictions on air travel were put into place by the Australian government due to COVID-19.
          Airports were unable to decrease their supply fast enough to account for the decreased demand, which is indicated by the increased distance from the diagonal line. 
          Airports were beginning to lose money because of the associated fixed costs with maintaining their airplanes in an operable state.
        </p>
        <p>
          By April 2020, we can see that airports have managed to scale back their supply in order to save on fixed costs due to the lower demand.
        </p>
        <p>Some interesting observations that can be made:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Despite having less number of total aircraft trips compared to <b><span class="brisbane_text">Brisbane</span></b>, <b><span class="melbourne_text">Melbourne</span></b> has a higher RPK. This indicates that Melbourne has higher airline traffic.</li>
          <li>During the months of August, September, and October, the <b><span class="karratha_text">Karratha</span></b> airport overtook most of the major airports in RPK. This indicates that there was some airline traffic during this time.</li>
          <li>Airports that have less aircraft trips on average tend to be more cost-efficient with less excess capacity. Larger airports with more aircraft trips on average tend to have more excess capacity. This could be because larger airports are expecting larger fluctuations in demand, and therefore increase their supply to accomodate for this.</li>
        </ul>
